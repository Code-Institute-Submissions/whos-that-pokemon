# [Who's that Pokémon?](https://orlamadden.github.io/whos-that-pokemon/)
Milestone project #2 for the Code Institute.

Every year, the Pokémon World Championships is held in August of each year, bringing together the best Pokémon TCG and video game players from around the globe. This year’s event is being held in the Excel in London, and is estimated at hosting 5,000 people including contestants, their family and their friends.

As part of the event, the organisers wanted a fun quiz app created that would entertain attendees and test their Pokémon knowledge. When users get a certain amount of points, they can redeem their points at the 'Poké Prizes' counter at the event to win Pokémon prizes.

## UX

### Wireframes

I used Adobe Illustrator to complete my wireframes. I made minor changes throughout the development stage so my website looks slightly different than the wireframes, but the core concept is still there.

Main quiz
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

### Surface

I wanted to capture the theme of the Pokémon franchise and the essence of the retro Pokémon games for this app. The typography was also inspired by the retro Pokémon games. The colour choice and typography add a friendly, approachable and slightly nostalgic feel to the app.
