# [Who's that Pokémon?](https://orlamadden.github.io/whos-that-pokemon/)
Milestone project #2 for the Code Institute.

Every year, the Pokémon World Championships is held in August of each year, bringing together the best Pokémon TCG and video game players from around the globe. This year’s event is being held in the Excel in London, and is estimated at hosting 5,000 people including contestants, their family and their friends.

As part of the event, the organisers wanted a fun quiz app created that would entertain attendees and test their Pokémon knowledge. When users get a certain amount of points, they can redeem their points at the 'Poké Prizes' counter at the event to win Pokémon prizes.

## UX

#### Project Goals

The primary goal of the quiz is to provide a clean, intuitive and fun game to entertain and delight it's users. 

#### User Stories

1.	As a user I want to play something fun to challenge my Pokémon knowledge.
2.	As a user I want to pass the time at the convention with a fun game.
3.	As a user I want large, easy to press buttons, so that I can press them on my mobile.
4.	As a user I want feedback on whether my answer is correct or not.
5.	As a user I want to know what my score is after each question.
6.	As a user I want to restart the game so I can try improve my score.


### Wireframes

I used Adobe Illustrator to complete my wireframes as part of the design and planning process for this project. I made minor changes throughout the development stage so my website looks slightly different than the wireframes, but the core concept is still there.

### Design Choices

I wanted to capture the theme of the Pokémon franchise and the essence of the retro Pokémon games for this app. The following design choices were made with this requirement:

#### Font
There are two fonts being used in this app. The default font is Open Sans and is used for most of the content copy. The second choice is VT323, which is a monospace font capturing the typography in the retro Pokémon games. This font is used in the main quiz container.

#### Colours
The primary colour choice is red and white, similar to the Pokémon brand. This was chosen for its friendly, approachable and slightly nostalgic feel for fans of the franchise.

## Features

1.	Game Dashboard - The game dashboard contains the question count, score, Pokémon silhouette, 4 answer choice buttons, info, help and reset buttons.

2.	Reset Button - The reset button, represented by a curved arrow icon from FontAwesome, resets the game. When the user presses the reset button, the question count returns to 1 and the score returns to 0.
