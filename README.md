# Who's that Pokémon?
Milestone project #2 for the Code Institute.

Every year, the Pokémon World Championships is held in August of each year, bringing together the best Pokémon TCG and video game players from around the globe. This year’s event is being held in the Excel in London, and is estimated at hosting 5,000 people including contestants, their family and their friends.

As part of the event, the organisers wanted a fun quiz app created that would entertain attendees and test their Pokémon knowledge. When users get a certain amount of points, they can redeem their points at the 'Poké Prizes' counter at the event to win Pokémon prizes.
